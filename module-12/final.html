                        Sitting down in front of a computer can take a toll on your physical body. Going on 
                        walks doesn’t just help my physical appearance but it also helps me to be in a better mood. 
                        I typically go out to the outdoors to venture on a bike trail, park, or the Omaha Henry Doorly Zoo. 
                        It is also nice to go out with a camera and take pictures of what I find interesting.

                    I am an aspiring software developer. Problem solving to make programs work more efficiently for 
                    someone is my passion. My main program language that I use today is Java. I can also program at 
                    a basic level in C, C++, and Python. I just recently got into web development so you will typically 
                    find me studying JavaScript at a nearby library or coffee shop.

                    I am active when it comes to problem solving, especially when it relates to games. I play board 
                    games with nearby friends. I typically try to find a strategy that can help me win most of the time. 
                    I have built a computer which I like to play video games on as well. Games are extremely fun way to 
                    stretch my skills and I am always down for a challenge.

                I worked at a nearby local grocery store called Hy-Vee while I was finishing my associates degree at Southeast 
                Community College. Working at Hy-Vee was fun, and I met new friends. I worked in produce where everything had 
                to be food safe and well placed. I also worked at Fresh Thyme, another local grocery, in the Deli department, 
                where I obtained my Food Handlers Permit to help follow safety protocols.

                Soon after I graduated from Southeast Community College, I became a residential technician at Allo Communications. 
                I enjoyed working at Allo, as I was forced to problem solve and fix issues that occurred on the job, as well as 
                install fiber and Cat5 cable lines throughout the residential home. The only reason why I left was because I 
                decided to go back to school for software development.

                Being a Landscaper at New Horizon had helped me financially get me through my studies at Bellevue. Being a landscaper 
                has helped me to really value the outdoors. I did hardscapes and softscapes where I both planted plants and built walls. 
                I also had the chance to work with heavy equipment such as MT’s and Bobcats. Landscaping is a hard job, but it helps make 
                the time fly by and is fulfilling when the job is complete.
