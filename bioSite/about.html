                Hannah is an inspiring artist. She is passionate about her artwork and people around her.
                Hannah fights for peoples right while at the same time making great artwork.
                She was a Seventh-day Adventist growing up, so she attended private schools
                that unfortunately did not have art classes due to the funding. Hannah had to learn
                artwork on her own with the limited tools given to her. Her supplies came from her parents
                and gifts from friends. When she graduated high school, she did not know exactly what she wanted
                to do. When she first started college, she only knew that she wanted to do something with art. Hannah
                first
                attended at Union College,
                in Lincoln, Nebraska as an Art Education major.

                Hannah is also very spontaneous. Hannah went to Italy the start of her
                sophomore year with only $2000 to live on throughout the whole year. Once Hannah came back from Italy
                her
                junior year,
                she then decided to change her major to Studio Art to acquire more art skills. At this point her true
                accomplishments begins.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Hannah graduated with her bachelors while being a Social Vice President on the ASB organization. This
                organization is known as the Associated Student Body that creates events for the whole school.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Hannah is now studying at the University of Nebraska Lincoln to achieve her master’s in Art History.
                While
                studying at UNL she also is working at the Great Plains Art Museum. She is extremely talented which got
                her
                the
                opportunity to curate her own show using the museum’s permanent art holdings and collection. This was
                huge
                for her because
                she was able to show how people express women being seen within a painting and how people perceive them.
                Hannah is devoted to human
                rights as she also donated art pieces to the Black Lives Matter Lincoln Chapter action. These art pieces
                acquired a significant price,
                so it was a huge personal accomplishment because it for an organization she was inspired by and
                passionate
                about. If you ever want to see
                Hannah’s artwork you can see it inside the Noyes Gallery. She is also doing her fourth Art and Garden
                show
                this year at the Sunken Gardens
                at the beginning of September.
