                The majority of Hannah’s hobbies revolve around art. Most of her works are done in watercolors and mixed
                media,
                but she also does Graphic Art and Fiber Art as well. Water coloring is an interesting type of painting
                style that
                allows the paint to be soluble in the water and flow and move more organically on the page. Mixed media
                art is a
                mixture of different paints, textures, inks, and materials on the same surface. Graphic Art, one of
                Hannah’s newest
                interests, usually involves a tablet and a pen to make fantastic sketches. Tufting, her most recent
                passion, is a
                special kind of skill that helps people to create rugs and imagery using a tufting gun (essentially a
                portable sewing machine),
                this is where she is beginning her skills in fiber arts.

            <p class="paragraph">
                If Hannah is not doing artwork at home, you will usually see her in a coffee shop. This is where she
                likes
                to chill and drink a smooth cup of coffee and sometimes do artwork as well. Hannah is usually working
                but
                when she is not, she likes to hangout with friends and family. A lot of her family lives outside of
                Lincoln
                so there is usually a lot of traveling involved which she loves because she gets to adventure out into
                different states.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Hannah is a relaxed person; all it takes for her to me rejuvenated is to take time to go out and enjoy
                nature. She loves taking nature walks and doing photography walks with her boyfriend whenever she gets
                the chance. Thrifting to find nice clothes in the local stores is also one of her specialties. She can
                almost
                find anything to wear within any shop she goes in. When Hannah was in high school, she used to be the
                baker
                in the cafeteria, to this day, she still enjoys baking and trying new recipes and sharing her treats
                with
                those she loves.
